Problem 1:Using the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) approach (or one of its extensions), present one goal specific to METRICSTICS and articulate 2N questions related to that goal, where N is the team size. Discuss whether any metrics help answer those questions. NOTES: The goals must aim to be SMART. 

Problem 2:Using the given description, construct a use case model for METRICSTICS. This description must include definitions of actors and use cases. NOTES There can be several use cases, including saving data in memory, restarting a session, and so on. A statistical calculator1 could be used as a motivation to ‘elicit’ necessary use cases.
